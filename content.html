            <p>According to scientists, global emissions should be cut to 45 per cent below 2010 levels by 2030 in order
                to limit global warming to 1.5&deg;C above pre -industrial levels.</p>

            <p>Emissions from developed countries were approximately 6.2 per cent lower in 2019 than in 2010, while
                emissions from 70 developing countries rose by 14.4 per cent in 2014.</p>

                Let&rsquo;s tell them that we are going to stop doing it. We&rsquo;re going to move to renewable energy,

                    <p>Economics</p>

                    <p>Technology</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s part of the institutional structure. If you aren&rsquo;t maximizing profit and market
                share, you aren&rsquo;t going to stand. Of course, there is a point to criticizing individuals, but the
                real point is that, within the system, they don&rsquo;t have a lot of choices. Therefore, we have to
                ask, &ldquo;What is it about the structure of our institutions that is leading us in this
                direction?&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;[Systems thinking] is a way of thinking that gives us the freedom to identify root causes of
                problems and see new opportunities.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>&ldquo;So, what is a system? A system is a set of things&mdash;people, cells, molecules, or
                whatever&mdash;interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time.
                The system may be buffeted, constricted, triggered, or driven by outside forces. But the system&rsquo;s
                response to these forces is characteristic of itself, and that response is seldom simple in the real
                world.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Systems are difficult because they may not appear as &ldquo;wholes&rdquo;. Unlike an engine or a tornado
                or a human being, they may be hard to see all at once.</p>

            <p>Systems are often dispersed in space, their &ldquo;system-ness&rdquo; experienced only over time,
                rendering them almost invisible. Or we may live within these systems seeing only a few individual parts,
                making the whole easy-to-overlook. We might call these &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; systems&mdash; or gossamer
                or ethereal or translucent systems.&nbsp;</p>

            <h2>The scale of these problems can be disheartening. Often it feels there is little we can do as
                individuals,&nbsp;</h2>
                <div>
            <p>Behind the scenes, many agents of change&mdash;at all organizational levels and in regions all over the
                world&mdash;are struggling. At the same time, we are far from meeting the social and environmental
                challenges of our day; we need to unlock more collaboration and more innovation. Finding ways to address
                the personal challenges change makers face is therefore important not only because it matters in and of
                itself, but also because it has the potential to drive more effective social change.</p>

            <p>Instead of rallying us, climate despair asks us to give up. In a<a
                    href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1075547008329201">&nbsp;2009 study</a> in the UK
                by researchers Saffron O&apos;Neill and Sophie Nicholson-Cole, climate-related data visualizations were
                presented to test subjects who were urged, in fear-based terms, to take action or else. Most of the time
                these appeals produced &quot;denial, apathy, avoidance, and negative associations.&quot; Ultimately, the
                researchers concluded, &quot;climate change images can evoke powerful feelings of issue salience but
                these do not necessarily make participants feel able to do anything about it; in fact, it may do the
                reverse.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

                to inspire others. To be part of a pattern.</h2>

            <p>The job of people like you, activists on the streets, people who are trying to change the world for the
                better, is to dismantle all of this stuff. It is to get people to see what is not that far from right in
                front of their eyes. None of it is very profound. You can talk about it to high school students. They
                often understand it better than graduate students at major universities, who have been more
                indoctrinated.&rdquo; &mdash; Noam Chomsky</p>

        <section>
            <h2>The power to change the system lies in the power to shift the paradigm they exist in.</h2>
            <div>

            <p>There is a difference between nouns and verbs. Money measures something real and has real meaning
                (therefore people who are paid less are literally worth less). Growth is good. Nature is a stock of
                resources to be converted to human purposes. Evolution stopped with the emergence of Homo sapiens. One
                can &ldquo;own&rdquo; land. Those are just a few of the paradigmatic assumptions of our current culture,
                all of which have utterly dumfounded other cultures,&nbsp;who thought them not the least bit obvious.
            </p>

            <p>Paradigms are the sources of systems. From them, from shared social agreements about the nature of
                reality, come system goals and information flows, feedbacks, stocks, flows and everything else about
                systems.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;But there&rsquo;s nothing physical or expensive or even slow in the process of paradigm change. In
                a single individual it can happen in a millisecond. All it takes is a click in the mind, a falling of
                scales from eyes, a new way of seeing. Whole societies are another matter &mdash; they resist challenges
                to their paradigm harder than they resist anything else.&nbsp;</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>So how do you change paradigms?</h2>
            <div>
            <p>Thomas Kuhn, who wrote the seminal book about the great paradigm shifts of science,7 has a lot to say
                about that.&nbsp;In a nutshell, you keep pointing at the anomalies and failures in the old paradigm, you
                keep coming yourself, and loudly and with assurance from the new one, you insert people with the new
                paradigm in places of public visibility and power. You don&rsquo;t waste time with reactionaries; rather
                you work with active change agents and with the vast middle ground of people who are open-minded.</p>

            <p>Now, capitalism is at the base of every successful economy and it balances supply and demand. It unlocks
                the higher fraction of human potential, and it&rsquo;s not going anywhere. But it needs to be reformed,
                because the way we measure what&rsquo;s valuable now ignores so-called &ldquo;negative
                externalities&rdquo; like pollution. It also ignores positive externalities like investments in
                education, health care, mental health care, family services. It ignores the depletion of resources like
                groundwater and topsoil, and the web of living species. And it ignores the distribution of incomes and
                net worth. So that we have &mdash;&nbsp;when GDP goes up, people cheer &mdash; two percent, three
                percent, wow, four percent, and they think, &ldquo;Great.&rdquo; But it is accompanied by vast increases
                in pollution, chronic underinvestment in public goods, the depletion of irreplaceable natural resources,
                and the worst inequality crisis we&rsquo;ve seen in more than 100 years that is threatening the future
                of both capitalism and democracy. So, we have to change it.&rdquo; &ndash;&ndash; Al Gore</p>

            <p>&hellip;Any kind of large, integrated institutional information-processing unit can only see the kinds of
                information they can process. And the kinds of information they can process are things like this&mdash;
                standardized, quantified information.</p>

            <p>If our taste and our values and our interests are varying and wide, and plural and rich, the state
                can&rsquo;t see that. The state can&rsquo;t get a handle on my bizarre taste in the tabletop
                role-playing games. So &hellip; &nbsp;if the state wants to be able to process our cares and our values,
                it would really help if our cares and our values aligned with the kinds of things that the state can
                easily measure. &mdash;C. Thi Nguyen</p>
